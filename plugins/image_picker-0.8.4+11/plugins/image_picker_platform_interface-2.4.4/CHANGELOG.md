## 2.4.4

* Internal code cleanup for stricter analysis options.

## 2.4.3

* Removes dependency on `meta`.

## 2.4.2

* Update to use the `verify` method introduced in plugin_platform_interface 2.1.0.

## 2.4.1

* Reverts the changes from 2.4.0, which was a breaking change that
  was incorrectly marked as a non-breaking change.

## 2.4.0

* Add `forceFullMetadata` option to `pickImage`.
  * To keep this non-breaking `forceFullMetadata` defaults to `true`, so the plugin tries
   to get the full image metadata which may require extra permission requests on certain platforms.
  * If `forceFullMetadata` is set to `false`, the plugin fetches the image in a way that reduces
   permission requests from the platform (e.g on iOS the plugin wonâ€™t ask for the `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` permission).

## 2.3.0

* Updated `LostDataResponse` to include a `files` property, in case more than one file was recovered.

## 2.2.0

* Added new methods that return `XFile` (from `package:cross_file`)
  * `getImage` (will deprecate `pickImage`)
  * `getVideo` (will deprecate `pickVideo`)
  * `getMultiImage` (will deprecate `pickMultiImage`)

_`PickedFile` will also be marked as deprecated in an upcoming release._
